# Cuda Experiments
I wanted to experiment with languages aside from C/C++ to launch cuda kernels.
This was originally inspired by a Reddit post that claimed to use the rust build
system to compile Cuda C code into a static library with a bindgen interface.
I plan to expand this to atleast one more language, probably zig due to its
recent popularity and my personal lack of knowledge of the language. Two birds,
one stone. I would also like to eventually do something more Java or C# like, to
get a feel for how reasonable something like this would be for the JVM.
Ultimately I looking to see how reasonable (for certain applications) doing
something similar in a larger project would be.
